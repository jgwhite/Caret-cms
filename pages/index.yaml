    # Caret is content management Simplified.
    
    Installing, configuring and deploying a content management is a headache. Caret eliminates all the setup and lets you get to work. It's perfect for basic content management needs, but is flexible enough to be the foundation of more powerful sites.
    
    As well as being fast, stable and secure, it's also built on the CodeIgniter framework so it's easy to integrate more complex functionality and only use Caret where you need it.
    
    ### The basics
    
    Instead of a database, Caret uses simple directory structure to manage the content of your site. All your data is stored in easy to read Yaml files which control every aspect of your site. You can define content exactly as you want it.
