    #### Really simple example

    ###### Write our data
    
    Let's make a really simple blog. In the pages/ folder, we'll create an index.yaml which will dictate the data for our homepage. Let's fill it out like so...

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1331179.js?file=index.yaml"></script>

    Above, I've defined a list of posts, a bit of dummy content and a title for the page. The template key is the **only** necessary key/value in Caret and it lets the system know which template you want to render the data with.

    The next thing to do is make that template.

    ###### Create the template

    Templates in Caret are written with the h2o templating language. It's really pretty and looks a bit like Liquid. Most of all, it's powerful & flexible so you can do practically anything with your data.

    Because we defined 'template: post' in our index.yaml file, Caret will look for a file called post.html in the templates folder. Let's put one together really quickly...

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/1331195.js?file=gistfile1.twig"></script>

    That was pretty painless wasn't it. Obviously that's not valid HTML, but it's enough for us to check everything's working. Let's have a look in our browser.
